  Question:-
  
  Drone zone:

Four Drones are placed in Grid [x * y] at fixed points. Given a target X on the Grid,
write an algorithm to find a Drone to strike the target. Print the path taken by the
drone to find the Target.
Hint : Use a 2d Matrix for Grid, Dive the drones to zones for scanning the target. If
the drone reaches the target then stop the loop
